1. Connected graph - There is a path (of length one or more) from 
any vertex to any other vertex.
2. Non connected graph has parts called connected components. 
Connected component is a maximal connected subgraph.
3. Bridge
Bridge is an edge in graph which is removed makes the graph disconnected.
4. Articulation point
A vertex in a graph which if removed makes the graph disconencted.
5. Biconencted graph
Is agraph that is conencted and has no articualtion points
Biconencted componets is maximal biconnected subgraph.
6. Strongly connected graph -
A graph in which for any pair of vertices (u,v) a path from u to v 
as well as v to u exists.
Strongly connected components of a graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph
7. Weekly connected graph
If undirected graph of a digraph is connected then digraph is said to be weekly conencted.
8. Tree - 
Is a acyclic connected graph (no cycles and all vertices are conecnted).
9. Forest -
Disjoint union of trees.
There is at most one path between any two vertices.

10. Spanning tree -
Subgraph T of connected graph G is a spanning tree of G -> 
T contains all the vertices of G and T is a tree.
Spanning Forest -
is a subgraph that consists of a spaning tree corresponding to each conneccted component.

11. Finding connected components -
BFS in Undirected graph.
While doing BFS we give label to each node and finally gather all nodes with same label as one conencted component.
