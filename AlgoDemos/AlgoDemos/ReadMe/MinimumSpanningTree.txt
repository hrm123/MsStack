Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) -
Given a connected graph G with positive edge weights, find minimum set of edges that connect all of the vertices.
This means MST has the least total weight to visit all vertices.
Applications - 
- Approximation algorithms for NP hard problems :
Travelling salesman problem (visit all locations with minimum cost),
- Phone company that wants lines to run between several points/locations
- max bottleneck paths, learning salient features for real-time dface verification, auto config
protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network etc.

- Prims algorithm; 

- Kruskals Algorithm:

1. Grpah og n vertices
2. Create forest of n distinct trees (with no edges) where each forest is one vertex.
3. In each step edges are joined so that number of forestes get reduced till finally we get single MST.
In each step -
Edge of graph is examined and is included if it does not form a cycle and has minimum weight.
